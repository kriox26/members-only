## Rails course - [Members Only Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/authentication) - TOP

**From [TOP](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/authentication)**: In this project, you'll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
